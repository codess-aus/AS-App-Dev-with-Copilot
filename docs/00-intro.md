### 🔮 What Copilot Does

GitHub Copilot is like your coding BFF. It watches what you type and throws in smart code suggestions — kinda like autocomplete but way smarter.

You’ll get suggestions when you:
- Type part of a code line 💻
- Write a comment 🗯️
- Leave a blank line ⬜

---

### ⚡ Speed Boost for Devs

Say you’re writing a C# method called `addInt` to add two numbers. Start typing and boom 💥 — Copilot finishes it for you.

![Copilot suggestion](assets/autocomplete-add-numbers.png)

No syntax colors = Copilot’s suggestion. Hit `Tab` to accept.  
Hit `Esc` to say “nah.”
![accept](assets/autocomplete-accept-tab.png)
---

### 🧠 Smarter Than It Looks

Let’s level up. You want a method that adds only prime numbers from a list. Start typing `addPrimeNumbersInNumericList` and Copilot’s got your back.

![numeric list](assets/autocomplete-add-numeric-list.png)

Looks good? Hit `Tab`.  
But wait — `isPrime` is red ❌. It’s missing.

![is primte](assets/autocomplete-isprime-issue.png)

Copilot knows best practices. It suggests you write `isPrime` separately.

![is primte](assets/autocomplete-isprime-suggestion.png)

---

### 🛠️ Managing Suggestions

Hover over a suggestion and you’ll see:
- ✅ Accept (or press `Tab`)
- 🧩 Accept Word (`Ctrl + >`)
- 🔄 View others (`Alt + ]` or `Alt + [`)

Want more control? Click `...` for:
- 📏 Accept Line
- 📌 Always Show Toolbar
- 🧭 Open Completions Panel

![Accept options](assets/autocomplete-accept-options-1.png)
![Accept options](assets/autocomplete-accept-options-2.png)
![Accept options](assets/autocomplete-accept-options-4.png)
---

### 💬 Comments = Code

Copilot reads your comments like magic spells 🪄.  
Write something like:

```csharp
// create a list of 100 random numbers between 1 and 1000
Copilot finishes the comment and starts generating code.
```

When you start entering the comment, GitHub Copilot suggests an autocompletion that completes the comment for you.
![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-1.png)

Accept each line as it appears.
![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-2.png)

When you create a new code line after the comment, GitHub Copilot begins generating a code snippet based on the comment and your existing code.
![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-3.png)

Accept each of the suggestions as they appear.
![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-4.png)

If GitHub Copilot isn't done, it generates another suggestion for you to accept.
![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-5.png)

![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-6.png)

If you enter a new code line after the code snippet is complete, GitHub Copilot generates another autocomplete suggestions based on the requirements of your code project
![comment code](assets/autocomplete-comment-code-7.png)


🧭 Explore More Suggestions
Not vibing with the first suggestion?
Press Ctrl + Enter or open the More Actions menu → Open Completions Panel.

![multiple options](assets/autocomplete-view-multiple-options-1.png)

You’ll see up to 10 options. Pick your fave or close the tab to reject all.

🧾 TL;DR
Copilot helps you code faster and smarter:

Type code, comments, or blank lines to get suggestions.
Accept with Tab, dismiss with Esc.
Use the toolbar to manage suggestions.
Comments can trigger full code snippets.
Open the Suggestions tab for more options.

# 💬 Copilot Chat: Inline, Smart, & Quick Modes

---

## ✍️ Inline Chat: Code While You Chat

Ask questions *right inside* your code editor. No switching tabs. No distractions.

### 🔓 How to open:
- 🧭 Copilot Chat menu → Editor Inline Chat  
- ⌨️ Shortcut: Ctrl + I  
- 🖱️ Right-click → Copilot → Editor Inline Chat

![Inline Chat](assets/inline-chat-1.png)

You can use an inline chat session to ask Copilot questions as you write or iterate your code.
When you open an inline chat session, the following interface is presented in the Editor.
![Inline Chat](assets/inline-chat-2.png)


### 💡 Use Case:
You're coding a C# app that makes a list of 100 random numbers.  

```csharp
// create a list of 100 random number between 1 and 1000
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
Random random = new Random();
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    numbers.Add(random.Next(1, 1000));
}
```

Now you need to **remove duplicates**. Instead of rewriting everything:

1. Highlight the code  
2. Hit Ctrl + I  
3. Ask: “Update this code to remove duplicates”  
4. Review → Accept or Rerun 🔁  
5. Not happy? Add more context or hit Discard ❌

![Inline Chat](assets/inline-chat-3.png)

---

## ⚡ Smart Actions: No Prompt Needed

Right-click a code snippet → Choose a smart action from the Copilot menu.
![Smart actions](assets/smart-actions-1.png)

### 🧠 Available Actions:
- **Explain** – What does this code do?  
- **Fix** – Got bugs? Copilot suggests fixes.  
- **Review & Comment** – Get feedback + best practices.  
- **Generate Docs** – Auto-doc your code.  
- **Generate Tests** – Create unit tests instantly.

### 🧪 Example:
You used inline chat to make a list of unique numbers.  
Now use **Review This** to improve it:

Copilot suggests:
- Use `HashSet<int>` for faster lookups  
- Pre-size the list to avoid resizing

But wait! Your method expects a `List<int>` 😬  
Use **Fix** smart action → Copilot adds `.ToList()` to fix it.

![Fix Smart Action](assets/smart-actions-2.png)

```csharp
HashSet<int> numbers = new HashSet<int>();
Random random = new Random();
while (numbers.Count < 100)
{
    int randomNumber = random.Next(1, 1000);
    if (!numbers.Contains(randomNumber))
    {
        numbers.Add(randomNumber);
    }
}

int sum = addPrimeNumbersInNumericList(numbers.ToList());
Console.WriteLine(sum);
```
