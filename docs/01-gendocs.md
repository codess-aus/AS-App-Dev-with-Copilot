## 📄 Document Code (aka “Make it readable!”)

Copilot helps you write clean, clear docs for your code:

### 🔹 Inline Docs

- **Ask Mode:**  
  Ask Copilot to write docs for files, classes, or methods. Review in chat, tweak, and insert.

- **Edit Mode:**  
  Get doc suggestions in the editor. Accept, reject, or remix them.

- **Agent Mode:**  
  Let Copilot auto-doc your code. It can multitask too! Review when it’s done.

- **Inline Chat:**  
  Use `/doc` or just ask. Docs show up in the editor—accept, reject, or rerun.

- **Generate Docs Smart Action:**  
  Select code → Right-click → “Generate Docs.” Easy peasy.

### 🔹 Project Docs

- **Ask Mode (Chat View):**  
  Understand your whole codebase. Copilot suggests README.md content. You review and insert.

- **Edit Mode (Chat View):**  
  Create or update README.md with Copilot’s help.

- **Agent Mode (Chat View):**  
  Copilot builds a full doc set: README.md, UsageExamples.md, ChangeLog.md. It links stuff and keeps it all consistent.

## ⚠️ Heads-Up!

Using **Agent Mode** might trigger **premium requests**. These depend on:
- Task complexity
- Number of steps
- Model used

## 🎯 TL;DR

GitHub Copilot = Code explainer + Doc writer + Workflow booster  
Use chat, smart actions, and inline tools to level up your dev game in VS Code.
