### 🔮 What Copilot Does

GitHub Copilot is like your coding BFF. It watches what you type and throws in smart code suggestions — kinda like autocomplete but way smarter.

You’ll get suggestions when you:
- Type part of a code line 💻
- Write a comment 🗯️
- Leave a blank line ⬜

---

### ⚡ Speed Boost for Devs

Say you’re writing a C# method called `addInt` to add two numbers. Start typing and boom 💥 — Copilot finishes it for you.

![Copilot suggestion](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-add-numbers.png)

No syntax colors = Copilot’s suggestion. Hit `Tab` to accept.  
Hit `Esc` to say “nah.”
![accept](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-accept-tab.png)
---

### 🧠 Smarter Than It Looks

Let’s level up. You want a method that adds only prime numbers from a list. Start typing `addPrimeNumbersInNumericList` and Copilot’s got your back.

![numeric list](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-add-numeric-list.png)

Looks good? Hit `Tab`.  
But wait — `isPrime` is red ❌. It’s missing.

![is primte](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-isprime-issue.png)

Copilot knows best practices. It suggests you write `isPrime` separately.

![is primte](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-isprime-suggestion.png)

---

### 🛠️ Managing Suggestions

### 💬 Comments = Code

Copilot reads your comments like magic spells 🪄.  
Write something like:

```csharp
// create a list of 100 random numbers between 1 and 1000
Copilot finishes the comment and starts generating code.
```

When you start entering the comment, GitHub Copilot suggests an autocompletion that completes the comment for you.
![comment code](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-comment-code-1.png)

When you create a new code line after the comment, GitHub Copilot begins generating a code snippet based on the comment and your existing code.
![comment code](https://github.com/codess-aus/AS-App-Dev-with-Copilot/blob/b602554366f49cdc1cc8462387f844ef1252898c/assets/autocomplete-comment-code-3.png)
