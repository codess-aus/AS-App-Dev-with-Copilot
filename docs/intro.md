### 🔮 What Copilot Does

GitHub Copilot is like your coding BFF. It watches what you type and throws in smart code suggestions — kinda like autocomplete but way smarter.

You’ll get suggestions when you:
- Type part of a code line 💻
- Write a comment 🗯️
- Leave a blank line ⬜

---

### ⚡ Speed Boost for Devs

Say you’re writing a C# method called `addInt` to add two numbers. Start typing and boom 💥 — Copilot finishes it for you.

> 🖼️ *[Insert screenshot of Copilot suggesting code]*

No syntax colors = Copilot’s suggestion. Hit `Tab` to accept.  
Hit `Esc` to say “nah.”

---

### 🧠 Smarter Than It Looks

Let’s level up. You want a method that adds only prime numbers from a list. Start typing `addPrimeNumbersInNumericList` and Copilot’s got your back.

> 🖼️ *[Insert screenshot of prime number method suggestion]*

Looks good? Hit `Tab`.  
But wait — `isPrime` is red ❌. It’s missing.

Copilot knows best practices. It suggests you write `isPrime` separately.

> 🖼️ *[Insert screenshot of isPrime method suggestion]*

---

### 🛠️ Managing Suggestions

Hover over a suggestion and you’ll see:
- ✅ Accept (or press `Tab`)
- 🧩 Accept Word (`Ctrl + >`)
- 🔄 View others (`Alt + ]` or `Alt + [`)

Want more control? Click `...` for:
- 📏 Accept Line
- 📌 Always Show Toolbar

---

### 💬 Comments = Code

Copilot reads your comments like magic spells 🪄.  
Write something like:

```csharp
// create a list of 100 random numbers between 1 and 1000
Copilot finishes the comment and starts generating code.
```

🖼️ [Insert screenshots of comment-driven code generation]

Accept each line as it appears.
Copilot even suggests calling your method with the list.

🧭 Explore More Suggestions
Not vibing with the first suggestion?
Press Ctrl + Enter or open the More Actions menu → Open Completions Panel.

Type code, comments, or blank lines to get suggestions.
Accept with Tab, dismiss with Esc.
Use the toolbar to manage suggestions.
Comments can trigger full code snippets.
Open the Suggestions tab for more options.
